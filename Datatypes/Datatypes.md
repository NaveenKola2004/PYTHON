# DATA TYPES
- Datatypes are used to define the type of data to used to the variables in the code
- like we are used name , for that we use sequense of charactures that means string
   - example
    - name="Naveen"
## Types of Datatypes 

1. int(Interger)
2. str(String)
3. float(Float)
4. List,[ ]
5. tuple,( )
6. set,{ }
7. frozen set ,{ }
8. dict (dictionary),(key:values),{ }


# INT (INTEGER)

1. interger means number
2. All the whole numbers

```python 
myNumber1=78
myNumber2=-12
```


# Str (STRING)

1. string is defined as the sequense of charactures
2. Enclosed with the single ' ' OR Double "  " queatations
3. It as the some methods 
4. we can Get the all types of methods by using this line of code
```python 
print(dir("str"))
```
5. String has having the indexing and slicing 
6. String is starting with the 0 for front side
7. For Back side starting with -1
```python
 N   A  V  E  E  N
 0   1  2  3  4  5
-6  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
```

8. Indexing
```python 
x="python"
print(x[0]) #Output p
print(x[-1]) #Output n
```
