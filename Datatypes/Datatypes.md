# DATA TYPES
- Datatypes are used to define the type of data to used to the variables in the code
- like we are used name , for that we use sequense of charactures that means string
   - example
    - name="Naveen"
## Types of Datatypes 

1. int(Interger)
2. str(String)
3. float(Float)
4. List,[ ]
5. tuple,( )
6. set,{ }
7. frozen set ,{ }
8. dict (dictionary),(key:values),{ }


# INT (INTEGER)

1. interger means number
2. All the whole numbers

```python 
myNumber1=78
myNumber2=-12
```


# Str (STRING)

1. string is defined as the sequense of charactures
2. Enclosed with the single ' ' OR Double "  " queatations
3. It as the some methods 
4. we can Get the all types of methods by using this line of code
```python 
print(dir("str"))
```
- String is Mutable 
- Support the 
  - add
  - update
  - delete
- String is ordered
- Support the Indexing and Slicing
- Allow the duplicate values

5. String has having the indexing and slicing 
6. String is starting with the 0 for front side
7. For Back side starting with -1
```python
 N   A  V  E  E  N
 0   1  2  3  4  5
-6  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
```

8. Indexing
```python 
x="python"
print(x[0]) #Output p
print(x[-1]) #Output n
```
9. Slicing
```python 
x="Naveen"
print(x[0:5]) #Output Navee
print(x[-4:-1]) #Output vee
```
- It this we are giving the [Start : Stop]
-  For Stop it will take the you entered the 5 it will take the 4 only it take the Stop as the previous number of you entered number

10. Make practice on the each method in the string
