## Approach and the logic and problem solving statements in the notes  just go through it

### 1.Find Factorial of a number
- This one also thir are many ways to find the factorial
- Looping through find factorial 
#### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇

```python
def Factorial(n):
    result=1
    if n==1 or n==0:
        return 1
    for i in range (1,n+1):
        result=result*i
    return result
n=int(input("Enter the number : "))
print(Factorial(n))
```

- Recursion through find factorial

#### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇
- Explanation in the image name is Factorialexplanation.png 

```python
def Factorial(n):
    if n==0 or n==1:
        return 1
    return n*Factorial(n-1)
n=int(input("Enter the number : "))
print(Factorial(n))
```


### 2.Count number of digits in a number
- This one counting the number of digits in an given number 
- ex :- 123 -> 3

```python
def Count_Digit_Number(n):
    count=0
    while (n>0):
        count+=1
        n=n//10
    return count
n=int(input("Enter the number : "))
print(Count_Digit_Number(n))
```
