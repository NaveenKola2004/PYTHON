## Approach and the logic and problem solving statements in the notes  just go through it


## Problem 1 Convert number to binary 

## Example 
- Take the 10 and the binary of the 10 is -> 1010

### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇

```python
def Solution(n):
    store=""
    while n>0:
        digit=n%2
        store=str(digit)+store
        n//=2
    return store
n=int(input())
print(Solution(n))

```
