## Approach and the logic and problem solving statements in the notes  just go through it

# 🧩 Day 4 – Pattern Building Using Nested Loops

### 🎯 Goal: Learn how inner and outer loops work together to create shapes.

#### ⚙️ Quick Recap — How Patterns Work

- Every pattern has two controls:
> Outer loop → controls rows
> Inner loop → controls columns or what’s printed in each row


# ⭐ Problem 1: Right-Angled Triangle

- Sample on

```python
*
**
***
****
*****
```

#### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇


```python
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1):
        print("*",end=" ")
    print()
```

# ⭐ Problem 2: Flipped Right-Angled Triangle

```python
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
* 
```
#### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇

```python
n=5
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i,n):
        print("*",end=" ")
    print()
```

# 🔹 Problem 3: Number Pyramid

```python
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 
```

#### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇

```python
n=5
for i in range(1,n+1):
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        print(j,end=" ")
    print()
```
