## Approach and the logic and problem solving statements in the notes  just go through it

### Question 1: Move All Zeros to the End

```python
Input: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
No extra list allowed (do it in-place). No sorting. One traversal preferred.
```

### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇

```python
def Move(n):
    j=0

    for i in range(len(n)):
        if n[i]!=0:
            n[i],n[j]=n[j],n[i]
            j+=1
    return n
print(Move([0,1,0,2,12]))
```

### 🧩 Question 2: Remove All Duplicate Characters

### Example
```python
Example:

Input: "programming"
Output: "progamin"
```

```python
Because:

repeated r, g, m → only first ones kept

Rules:

No using set()

No using dict to store frequency
(Do it manually with logic)
```
### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇

```python
def Find(n):
    k=""
    for i in n:
        if i not in k:
            k+=i
    return k
n=input()
print(Find(n))
```
