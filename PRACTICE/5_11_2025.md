## Approach and the logic and problem solving statements in the notes  just go through it

### 🎯 Goal: Learn how inner and outer loops work together to create shapes.

# ⭐ Problem 1: Half Pyramid (Left Aligned with Spaces)

```python
          * 
        * * 
      * * * 
    * * * * 
  * * * * * 
```

#### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇

```python
n=5
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i,n):
        print(" ",end=" ")
    for k in range(i+1):
        print("*",end=" ")
    print()
```

# 🔺 Problem 2: Full Pyramid

```python
          * 
        * * * 
      * * * * * 
    * * * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * * * 
```

#### Hear is the sample code in python 👇👇

```python
n=5
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i,n):
        print(" ",end=" ")
    for k in range(i+1):
        print("*",end=" ")
    for l in range(1,i+1):
        print("*",end=" ")
    print()
```

# 🔻 Problem 3: Inverted Full Pyramid

```python
