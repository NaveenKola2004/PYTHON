- In loop we actually know in other languages,for and do-while
- In this also same but some difference

- For Looping writeing in the code different and while also
- in for we have some types like,range and in and some others
- lopping are actually used for the iteration
- It has the iterator,iterable
<details><summary><strong> ➡️FOR LOOP</strong></summary>

1. range()

- It iteration using the range values

```python
n=5
for i in range(1,n+1):
    print(i)
```

2. IN

- Actually we are well know about the in operator,it check the condition like the given value is present are not in the list are string are set any iterable datatype

```python
n=[1,2,3,4,5]
for i in n:
    print(i)
```
- Above one it i is assign to each word untils it reaches the all elements in list and print the all values so it has the i value is changes until is all list elements are printed in the list

- We have some more things so we disscuss later
</details>


<details><summary><strong>➡️ While</strong></summary>

- It starts the iteration will start the given condition is true
- It iteration will stops the until given condtion is went false it stops the iteration

```python
i=1
while(i<=5):
    print(i)
    i=i+1
```

- Like the it will works
</details>

<details><summary><strong>➡️ NESTED LOOPS</strong></summary>

- It means loops inside the loops

```python
n1=5
n2=1
for i in range(1,n1+1):
    while (n2<=5):
        print(n2)
        n2=n2+1
    print(i)
```

- It is an example to the nested loops
- Practice the all assignment questions
