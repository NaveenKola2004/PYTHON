# 🎯 Abstraction — "Show only what's needed"

Abstraction means **hiding the complex parts** and showing only the **essential features**.

## 💡 Simple Vibe Check
When you drive a car:
- You use steering, brakes, and accelerator  
- You don’t worry about engine combustion, fuel injectors, wiring, sensors, etc.  

All the messy internal stuff is hidden from you.

## 🧠 Why It Matters?
- Makes things easy to use  
- Prevents users from getting overwhelmed  
- Lets you focus on *what* it does, not *how* it works


# Example

```python
