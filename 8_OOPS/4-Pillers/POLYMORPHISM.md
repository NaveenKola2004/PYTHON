# 🎭 Polymorphism — "One face, many masks"

Polymorphism means **the same action can behave differently** based on who performs it.

## 💡 Simple Vibe Check

Command: **"move"**

- A car → rolls 🚗  
- A bird → flies 🐦  
- A fish → swims 🐟  

Same command, different actions.

## 🧠 Why It Matters?
- Gives flexibility  
- You write generic commands  
- Objects decide how to perform it  
- Makes code clean and adaptable


# Example

```python
