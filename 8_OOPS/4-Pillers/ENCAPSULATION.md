# 🔒 Encapsulation — "Protect the vibe"

Encapsulation means **wrapping data and methods together** into a single unit (object) and **restricting direct access** to some parts of it.

You decide:
- What outsiders can access ✔️  
- What should stay hidden ❌  

## 💡 Simple Vibe Check
Just like your smartphone:
- You can use the apps (public stuff)
- But you cannot directly touch the internal circuits (private stuff)

## 🧠 Why It Matters?
- Protects data from accidental damage  
- Avoids unwanted external interference  
- Makes your code cleaner, less chaotic  
- Gives controlled access through methods

## 🧭 In Short
Encapsulation = Keeping your data safe + giving access only the right way.
