# 🧬 Inheritance — "Hand-me-downs, but good ones"

Inheritance means **one object (child)** can take the **properties and behaviours** of another object (parent).

Child gets:
- All features from the parent ✔️  
- Ability to add its own special features 💨  

## 💡 Simple Vibe Check
Think of a basic **Car** as the parent class.  
A **SportsCar** inherits everything from Car but adds **turbo**, **nitro**, **spoilers**, and attitude.

## 🧠 Why It Matters?
- Saves time  
- Avoids rewriting the same code  
- Keeps your structure clean and organized  
- Encourages classic programming flow while still letting you upgrade things

## 🧭 In Short
Inheritance = Reuse the old stuff, add the spicy new stuff.
