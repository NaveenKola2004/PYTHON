# Programming vs Coding

## Programming

### Definition
Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform tasks or solve problems. It involves designing, planning, and implementing logic to make a computer do what you want.

### Importance
- Automates repetitive tasks.
- Solves complex problems using logical steps.
- Enables the development of software, websites, apps, and games.
- Helps manage and analyze large amounts of data.

### Key Points
- Programming is broader than coding; it includes problem-solving, planning, and designing algorithms.
- A good programmer first understands the problem, plans the solution, and then writes code.
- Programming involves core concepts like variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, and input/output.

### Analogy
- Programming is like planning a road trip: choosing the route, stops, and resources.
- Coding is the act of driving the car according to the planned route.

## Coding

### Definition
Coding is the process of writing instructions in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It is the implementation part of programming.

### Importance
- Enables computers to perform tasks and solve problems.
- Bridges the gap between human ideas and machine execution.
- Forms the foundation for all software development, from apps to websites to games.

### Key Points
- Coding is a subset of programming.
- Programming involves planning, designing, and problem-solving; coding is the act of writing the instructions.
- Computers cannot execute tasks without coding, as they require precise commands.
- You can plan a program without coding (e.g., using pseudocode), but actual execution requires code.

### Analogy
- Programming = planning a road trip.
- Coding = actually driving the car along the planned route.



# Programming vs Coding – Real-World Examples

## 1. Cooking a Dish

### Programming
- Writing the full recipe.  
- Decide what ingredients you need.  
- Choose the cooking method.  
- Arrange the steps in the right order.  

### Coding
- Actually following the recipe in the kitchen.  
- Cutting, frying, mixing—step by step actions.  

**Mapping:**  
- Recipe (plan) = **Programming**  
- Cooking (execution) = **Coding**

## 2. Building a House

### Programming
- Creating the architectural blueprint.  
- Deciding where walls, doors, and windows will be.  
- Planning plumbing, wiring, and safety rules.  

### Coding
- Construction workers laying bricks.  
- Installing doors, wiring cables, and plumbing pipes.  
- Following the design step by step.  

**Mapping:**  
- Blueprint = **Programming**  
- Construction = **Coding**

# What is Machine Code?

## Definition
Machine code is the lowest-level programming language, consisting of binary digits (0s and 1s). It directly represents the instructions executed by a computer's CPU.

## Characteristics
- Fastest and most direct communication with hardware.
- Not human-friendly; very hard to read and maintain.
- Example of machine code instruction:  
  `10110000 01100001` 
## Relationship with Other Languages
1. **High-Level Language (Python, Java)** → Easy for humans to understand.    
2. **Machine Code** → Final binary form (0s and 1s) that CPU executes.

- In short: Machine code = The CPU’s mother tongue.
- Everything else (Python, C, Java, even Assembly) eventually turns into machine code - before the computer can actually run it.
